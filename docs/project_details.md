## Platform Logic

### Core Escrow Workflow

1. **Contract Creation**
   - The client initiates an escrow contract by specifying:
     - Project title and description
     - Total payment amount in USDT
     - Freelancer's wallet address
     - Optional: Milestone structure with individual payment amounts and deadlines
   - The system generates a unique contract ID and stores contract details on-chain
   - Smart contract event emitted for contract creation

2. **Fund Locking Mechanism**
   - Client connects wallet and approves USDT transfer to escrow contract
   - Smart contract verifies fund availability and transfers USDT from client wallet
   - Funds are locked in the escrow contract with specific release conditions
   - Both parties receive confirmation of successful fund locking
   - Timelock safety mechanism activated (default: 90 days)

3. **Work Execution and Verification**
   - Freelancer performs work according to agreement terms
   - Freelancer submits evidence of work completion through platform interface
   - Evidence is stored with timestamps and hash verification
   - Client receives notification of work submission for review

4. **Fund Release Process**
   - Client reviews submitted work evidence
   - If approved, client confirms completion through interface
   - Smart contract verification of release authorization
   - Funds transferred to freelancer's wallet address minus platform fee
   - Transaction record created with confirmation from blockchain
   - Both parties receive notification of successful completion

5. **Cancellation Process**
   - Either party can request cancellation through interface
   - Counterparty receives notification and can approve/reject cancellation
   - If mutual agreement reached, smart contract unlocks funds
   - Funds returned to client wallet minus minimal transaction fees
   - If disagreement, escalation to dispute resolution process
   - Automatic cancellation possible after timelock expiration if no activity

### Milestone-Based Payment Logic

1. **Milestone Structure**
   - During contract creation, client defines:
     - Number of milestones (1-10 supported)
     - Payment amount per milestone (sum equals total contract value)
     - Deadline for each milestone (optional)
     - Description and deliverables for each milestone

2. **Milestone Fund Allocation**
   - Total contract funds locked in smart contract
   - Internal accounting tracks funds allocated to each milestone
   - Smart contract maintains milestone status (pending, in-progress, completed, disputed)

3. **Milestone Completion Flow**
   - Freelancer marks milestone as completed and submits evidence
   - Client reviews evidence and approves/rejects completion
   - Upon approval, only the specific milestone amount is released
   - Remaining funds stay locked for future milestones
   - Each milestone completion triggers smart contract events

4. **Milestone Modification**
   - Changes to milestone structure require mutual agreement
   - Both parties must sign transaction approving modifications
   - Smart contract updates milestone structure while maintaining fund security
   - Modification history preserved for transparency

5. **Milestone Deadline Logic**
   - System tracks approaching deadlines and sends notifications
   - Visual indicators show milestone status relative to deadline
   - Expired deadlines flagged but don't automatically trigger actions
   - Deadline extensions require mutual approval from both parties

### Dispute Resolution Logic

1. **Dispute Initiation**
   - Either party can flag a dispute through interface with required reason
   - Disputed funds remain locked in smart contract
   - Counterparty notified of dispute with details
   - Dispute status recorded on-chain with timestamp

2. **Evidence Submission**
   - Both parties can submit evidence supporting their position
   - Evidence types include documents, screenshots, communications, code repositories
   - All submissions timestamped and stored with secure hashing
   - Evidence visible to both parties for transparency

3. **Resolution Process**
   - Direct communication channel activated between parties
   - Platform provides structured negotiation framework
   - Both parties can propose resolution terms
   - Resolution requires digital signatures from both parties
   - Multiple resolution attempts tracked and preserved

4. **Resolution Implementation**
   - Once agreement reached, resolution terms executed via smart contract
   - Funds distributed according to resolution terms
   - Dispute marked as resolved with outcome recorded
   - Both parties receive confirmation of resolution
   - Transaction records preserved for future reference

5. **Deadlock Resolution**
   - If parties cannot reach agreement within timeframe (default: 30 days)
   - Optional escalation to third-party mediation (future feature)
   - Timelock expiration mechanism as final safeguard
   - System proposes compromise solutions based on similar past disputes
   - Would be fantastic to address how disputes could be escalated and resolved in future versions through decentralized arbitration networks, reputation-based mediator selection, and specialized domain experts for different types of work

### Wallet Integration Logic

1. **Wallet Connection Flow**
   - User prompted to connect Polkadot.js extension or compatible wallet
   - Connection request with clear permission scope displayed
   - User approves connection in wallet extension
   - Platform verifies wallet ownership through signature request
   - Session established with appropriate permissions

2. **Account Management**
   - Users can connect multiple wallet addresses
   - Primary wallet address designated for platform interactions
   - Account balances checked before transaction attempts
   - Address book feature for saving frequently used addresses
   - Network fee estimation before transaction approval

3. **Transaction Signing Process**
   - All blockchain transactions require explicit user approval
   - Transaction details presented in clear, human-readable format
   - Platform prepares transaction parameters
   - User signs transaction in wallet extension
   - Platform monitors transaction confirmation status
   - Success/failure notification with transaction hash reference

4. **Security Mechanisms**
   - No private keys ever stored or accessed by platform
   - Session timeouts for wallet connections
   - Transaction value limits configurable by users
   - Multi-signature requirement for high-value transactions
   - Address verification through QR code option

### Smart Contract Security Logic

1. **Access Control**
   - Role-based permissions (client, freelancer, platform)
   - Function-level access restrictions based on contract state
   - Ownership verification before critical operations
   - Multi-signature requirements for high-value actions

2. **Fund Safety Mechanisms**
   - Non-custodial design (platform never controls funds)
   - Timelock expiration for recovery of abandoned contracts
   - Transaction value limits during platform beta
   - Emergency pause functionality for critical vulnerabilities
   - Reentrancy attack protection on all fund transfers

3. **State Machine Logic**
   - Contracts follow strict state transition rules
   - States: Created ‚Üí Funded ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Completed/Disputed/Cancelled
   - Each state transition verified against preconditions
   - Events emitted for all state changes
   - Invalid state transitions rejected with clear error messages

4. **Fee Calculation Logic**
   - Platform fee (0.5-1%) calculated at contract creation
   - Fee deducted only from successfully completed transactions
   - Fee split mechanism for marketplace integrations (future feature)
   - Transparent fee display before transaction approval
   - Fee held in separate accounting within contract until release

5. **Error Handling Logic**
   - Comprehensive error detection and handling
   - User-friendly error messages with resolution suggestions
   - Transaction failure recovery mechanisms
   - Automatic retry for certain non-critical operations
   - Detailed error logging for platform monitoring

### Stablecoin Integration Logic

1. **Token Handling**
   - PSP22 token standard implementation for USDT
   - Token approval and allowance management
   - Balance verification before transaction attempts
   - Gas fee estimation and reserve checking
   - Transaction confirmation monitoring

2. **Transaction Verification**
   - Double validation of transaction success (event + balance check)
   - Transaction hash recording and verification
   - Block confirmation waiting for finality
   - Receipt generation with complete transaction details
   - Cross-referencing with blockchain explorer

3. **Token Security**
   - Secure token transfer patterns
   - Check-Effect-Interaction pattern to prevent reentrancy
   - Balance verification before and after transfers
   - Gas optimization for token operations
   - Overflow/underflow protection for all calculations
