# How .escrow Graduated From Prototype to Production

Six weeks ago we shared a raw, smart-contract proof of concept. Today that idea has matured into a production-ready payments network for the global freelance economy. This article captures what changed in Milestone 2, why it matters to the people who depend on timely payouts, and where we are headed next.

## Why .escrow Exists

The freelance economy keeps growing, but the payment rails still look like 2005: high fees, slow clearance, and trust gaps. Our goal has always been simple—lock funds when work starts, release instantly when work is approved, and keep everyone protected in between.

**Before .escrow**
- 5–10 day settlement times
- 6–12% in platform and FX fees
- Manual dispute workflows that depend on human goodwill

**After .escrow**
- < 6 second settlement on Polkadot once a milestone is approved
- Flat 1% platform fee (with a public roadmap to lower tiers as volume grows)
- Milestone tracking, evidence uploads, and transparent on-chain dispute triggers

The outcome is tangible: beta testers processed $89k in work during Milestone 2 with a 99.3% success rate and zero lost funds.

## Real People, Real Impact

- **Maria, UX designer (Mexico City)** – “I start every project knowing the money is already locked in. When the client approves, I’m paid in seconds.”
- **David, startup founder (San Francisco)** – “I can fund work confidently. If milestones slip, the funds stay protected until both of us agree on next steps.”
- **Priya, content writer (Bengaluru)** – “The fee savings alone paid my rent last month. I also love that the dispute path is clear and documented.”

We now support 97 active users across 15 countries, with freelancers and clients collaborating without the usual anxiety around international payouts.

## What Shipped in Milestone 2

### 1. A Product Tour

| Experience | Highlights |
|------------|------------|
| **Dashboard** | Snapshot of active escrows, status chips, and live balance indicators. |
| **Creation Flow** | Four-step wizard that captures project details, counterparty info, milestones, and review. |
| **Milestone Tracking** | Evidence uploads, status badges, and countdowns to deadlines. |
| **Dispute Desk** | One-click escalation with contextual notes that both parties can view. |

Every screen refreshes off chain events so both sides see the same truth without hitting refresh or digging through block explorers.

### 2. Governance & Safety

- **Multi-signature administration**—critical actions (pause/unpause, fee updates, emergency withdrawals, signer rotation) now require proposal + threshold approvals. Ten dedicated tests cover the new proposal lifecycle.
- **Proposal audit trail**—every administrative action emits structured events so our internal dashboard can display who proposed, who approved, and when it executed.
- **Testing wall**—the suite grew from 8 to 23 ink! tests, plus frontend integration checks. Coverage spans escrow creation, fee validation, milestone lifecycle, dispute flags, and multisig flows.

### 3. Honest Deadline Handling

Deadlines are now treated as indicators, not automatic triggers. When a date slips, the funds stay locked until both parties either renegotiate or file a dispute—exactly what users told us they wanted. Documentation, UI copy, and support scripts now reflect this “deadlines as signals” philosophy.

## Architecture Without the Jargon

1. **Frontend (React + Chakra UI)** – wallet connection, milestone workflows, real-time event subscriptions via Polkadot.js.
2. **Integration Layer** – thin hooks that translate human-friendly forms into contract calls, handle optimistic updates, and roll back if the chain rejects a transaction.
3. **Ink! Contract (1,700+ LOC)** – milestone ledger, PSP22 transfers, dispute flags, proposal-based admin controls, and event emission.

We also invested time shaving 40% off the initial bundle size, bringing first paint down to ~1.2s.

## Roadmap Snapshot

- **Next 30 days** – Launch the internal admin dashboard that visualises multisig proposals, approvals, and signer management. Begin mobile responsiveness polish for milestone pages.
- **3–6 months** – Introduce optional yield accounts for long-running escrows, add contractor bulk management tools, and extend wallet support.
- **Long term** – Progressive decentralisation via DAO voting, multi-language clients, and cross-parachain payouts through XCM.

## Call to Action

- **Freelancers and agencies** – Lock your next client payment in .escrow and get paid the moment your work is approved.
- **Clients and procurement leads** – Reduce payment risk with milestone-based releases and transparent dispute flows.
- **Developers** – The repo is open source. Help us integrate more wallets, extend analytics, or build the admin dashboard.
- **Partners & investors** – We are actively exploring integrations and strategic capital to accelerate the roadmap.

We began Milestone 2 with a working contract. We’re ending it with a platform that freelancers already trust with their livelihoods. The mission is unchanged: make getting paid for good work instant, inexpensive, and borderless.

**Let’s build the future of work, together.**
